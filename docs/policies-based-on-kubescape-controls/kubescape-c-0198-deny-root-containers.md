# Kubescape C-0198: Deny root containers

## Why this policy is required:
Running containers as root (UID 0) grants full privileges inside the container, increasing the impact of a container breakout. Explicitly setting `runAsUser: 0` should be blocked, and containers should run with a non-root UID or inherit a non-root UID from the pod security context.

## Severity Level: High

## Configuration Parameters:
* Not Configurable

## Resources this policy could be applied to:
* CronJob
* DaemonSet
* Deployment
* Job
* Pod
* ReplicaSet
* StatefulSet

## What does this policy do:
This Policy checks every container and initContainer for an explicit or inherited `runAsUser` of 0. It first checks if the container has `securityContext.runAsUser` set; if so, that value must not be 0. If the container does not set its own `runAsUser`, the pod-level `securityContext.runAsUser` is checked instead. If either evaluates to 0, the resource is denied.
